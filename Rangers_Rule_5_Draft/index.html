			Every December, a unique draft occurs in Major League Baseball. Unlike the Amateur draft, where teams select unproven high school and college players, the Rule 5 draft allows teams to select minor league players from other clubs. Named after its place in the official MLB rule book, the Rule 5 draft plays an important role in competitive balance, as teams with high talent and depth will inevitably have their players taken in this draft, if they are not quickly elevated to the big league level.
To help teams find the best value among the vast swathes of minor league players, I created this interactive visualization allowing for pitchers to be compared across 4 stats and permutations. </p>

			The Rangers go into the draft with the 8 pick. The above graph allows comparison between Strike Out Percent(SO%), 
			Walk Percent(BB%), Batting Avaerage on Balls In Play(BABIP), and Earned Run Average(ERA). Based on the above graph the recommendation
			for the Rangers would be Dany Jimenez. Jimenez has a BABIA of 0.328, a SO% of 35, and a BB% of 15. The second recommendation 
			would be Trevor Megill. Megill shows excellent command, but does not quite measure up to Jimenez in terms of SO%
			and BABIA.

			The draft results ended up with Jimenez being drafted at 7, and Megill being drafted number 9. The Rangers decided to opt out 
			of their pick.
