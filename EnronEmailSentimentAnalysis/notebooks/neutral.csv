We have recently completed the project and would like to solicit your feedback on the report results. We have selected your NG price position for April 4, 2000 (POST-ID  753650) for the initial analysis.  Attached in the excel file below you will find: Analysis across the various forward months in your position  Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&LTime change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L Summary of your Overall Position analysis Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&LTime change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L Multiple Stress Analysis The attached Word document demonstrates the multiple stress choices.  I have included a tab in the excel file that demonstrates the theoretical P/L resulting from shifts in both volatility and underlying price.   Please note that the percentage changes across the column headers are not in absolute terms (for example, if the ATM volatility in a given month is 40% and the stress is -10% then the analysis is performed under a volatility scenario of 36%)     Thanks, Rudi "
"Dutch:The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market. Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's position and a corresponding decrease occurred today.John"

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and I'll take care of it.. On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of $235,019.   (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988) Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to GDP-Kingsgate.  Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in case there's something you want to do about it.

Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them for all the locations.The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol curves from historical data.I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price curves for NG and all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers based on these curves:      5/30/00  5/31/00AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225 You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which would give more weight to recent data.We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.

Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side. On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price. I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption.

"Good job....I've got 10% of my portfolio in CGP.   Keep up the good work.  ""Cooper, Sean"" <CooperS@EPEnergy.com> on 07/11/2000 08:03:41 PMTo: cc:  Subject: El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000711/tx_el_paso_2.html Tuesday July 11, 5:42 pm Eastern TimeCompany Press ReleaseSOURCE: El Paso Energy CorporationEl Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per ShareHOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) todayannounced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earningsper share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per shareof one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstandingfor the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjustedearnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the secondquarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 millionin the year-ago period.EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in thequarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance inour other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' saidWilliam A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso EnergyCorporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolioof flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued toaccelerate in the second quarter.''For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per shareincreased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the firstsix months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excludingnon-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515million in the year-ago period.Second Quarter Business Segment ResultsThe Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in thesecond quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last yearand $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gasand power portfolio developed over the past several years is creatingsignificant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhancedtrading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesalecustomer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company'soff-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributedto the record second-quarter performance.The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBITto $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higherrealized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following thereorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices forthe quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, fromthe year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per dayand oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was dueprimarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together withthe acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillionBtu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural GasTransmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million comparedwith an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of costsavings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlementfiled in March.The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 millioncompared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects inBrazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company'sinvestment in the Philippines.Telecom Update``We have made substantial progress in the development of ourtelecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso MerchantEnergy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in buildingbusinesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our MerchantEnergy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in thetelecommunications marketplace.''Quarterly DividendThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share onthe company's outstanding common stock.

It looks as if during the month of June, the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but assigned multiple master deal ID's.  (the code is ""NG-OPT-XL-PRC"")For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: June 1st  $797 million dollars lossJune 2nd +192 million dollars madeJune 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..) This problem makes it impossible to backtest.... Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily increasing your limit to $45 million.  This limit increase is in effect until July 26th.  The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution can be devised.....  I hope this helps.Thanks,Frank    John Arnold@ECT07/14/2000 02:33 PMTo: Frank Hayden/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject:  Frank:Just following up on two topics.One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact his P&L is never close to that.

If you do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should discuss, but they should not get in the way of release. If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august. any questions please feel free to call. -andy "

"Frank:One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position currently.  But in the winter that may change.Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.   While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the payout probabilities may look like the following: 20%  $ -.0540%     $ -.0220% $ 019% $ .031% $ 1       	Enron North America Corp.

"thanks To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: FW: trading with Campbell   FYI. I spoke with Steve. Seems like they have not been successful with plan A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC trading. Still has the rating problem with Enron, but I am trying to get him to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. He will try to do so this week.

"Although I would prefer to see the counterparty name for failed transactions, it is not of great importance and I certainly understand a third party system not supplying us with that info.  Andy Zipper@ENRON07/31/2000 01:51 PMTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Houston Street John, As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your thoughts/concerns. -Andy "

"Mac,  Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:   Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year    Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf   Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.     Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share  That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.

The vol curve here is marked very similarly to the Nymex curve at the front but drops off to a much lower level at the back. Richard Lewis, who is in charge of UK Gas and Power trading, would like to discuss the rationale behind the longer end of the NG curves, both vol and price. Could we all get on the phone sometime next week (Monday is a holiday here) perhaps before the open or shortly after the close? (The Nymex closes at 8pm UK time.) Thanks, Dave "

Please correct me if I am wrong. I have scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 4pm with you to discuss the 2001 direct expense plan for Financial Gas trading.  I will have a schedule that details your 2000 plan, 2000 estimate based on the first 6 months of 2000 and a template for the 2001 plan.   I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you tomorrow: 1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount?  If so, what level of person?2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want to plan for?5) Are you expecting any promotions?6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement agencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should plan for?  If so, how much and where?9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, monitors and software?10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.) My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished before Paula Harris took over.  She will be coming to the meeting with me.  Please let me know if you need any additional information prior to the meeting. Thanks!Suzanne   "

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region's growing number of dot-coms.                         Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com.                         Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the Internet economy.                         It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.                        Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security                  facilities.                         ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. ""That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.""                         A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.                         Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  Karzmar said.                         Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                         For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                         On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.                         Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                         ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,"" said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                         ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.""                         With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space &                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.                         ""It is probably the largest data center park in the country,"" boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications,                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                         After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                         As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  Seattle continues to escalate.                         But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California.                         Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                         ""We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in                  Seattle.                         The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                         ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,""                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in                  a way.""     "

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region's growing number of dot-coms.                         Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com.                         Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the Internet economy.                         It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.                        Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security                  facilities.                         ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. ""That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.""                         A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.                         Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  Karzmar said.                         Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                         For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                         On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.                         Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                         ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,"" said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                         ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.""                         With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space &                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.                         ""It is probably the largest data center park in the country,"" boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications,                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                         After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                         As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  Seattle continues to escalate.                         But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California.                         Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                         ""We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in                  Seattle.                         The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                         ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,""                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in                  a way.""     "

""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. ""That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.""                         A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.                         Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  Karzmar said.                         Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                         For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                         On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.                         Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                         ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,"" said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                         ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.""                         With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space &                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.                         ""It is probably the largest data center park in the country,"" boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications,                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                         After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                         As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  Seattle continues to escalate.                         But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California.                         Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                         ""We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in                  Seattle.                         The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                         ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,""                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in                  a way.""     "

"I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is $3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.   Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin costs.   "
"Dave:A couple things about the limit orders: 1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.  Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.  Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading session unless specified otherwise.   2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.  When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the quantity to be 15,000.   3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system saying error trade, price not available. 4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a valuable feature. Thx,John"

"George,  Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate project:  Ownership Structure  What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?  What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and  liabilities)?  Who owns the land? improvements?  Who holds the various loans?  Is the land collateral?  Investment  What happens to initial investment?  Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?  When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule?  Investment Return  Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?  Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed?  Debt  Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each  loan?  Improvement  Construction  Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.  Terms of each loan?  Uses of Funds  How will disbursements be made?  By whom?  What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors?  Reports to track expenses vs plan?  Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?  What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a  general contractor and paid gain out of profits?  Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits?  Design and Construction  When will design be complete?  What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?  What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting?  Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals?  Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?  Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? Names? These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn asmuch as possible from the process. Phillip              "

Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment Structure STRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value. DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value. DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value. DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.

"I'm not sure what is happening on my position.  It may have to do with how you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.

Under the $7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price curves proportionally shifted.  Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly. Key findings include:$7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%  $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134%          It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the financial desk actually decreased.  This would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces risk).  But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and increasing VaR by 74%.  Does this make sense or is something else happening?

My short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural appears to be waning at present.? Volume on this rally is  poor, particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside.? The  market appears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels.? If  we are at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would be extremely  bullish.? Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not so great.?  Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural.? Bigger picture is still  very bullish.? However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of what I would  call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big move to the  upside.?Let me know if this stuff is useful for you.?

From:  Gary Taylor                           10/05/2000 07:25 PM	 To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Griffith/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: SMUD deal Asian options John(s), How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know. Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to argue for one or the other. Regards,Garyx31511 "

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project. I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project. I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation. Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan. Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).

Unfortunately, our customer would like to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) - so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your offer.

From:  Gary Taylor                           10/05/2000 07:25 PM	 To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Griffith/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:  Subject: SMUD deal Asian options John(s), How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know. Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to argue for one or the other. Regards,Garyx31511    "

"pira's certainly got the whole market wound up.  I've seen a wave of producer selling for the first time in two months over the past two days.  Most selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira.  Pira certainly commands a lot of respect these days.  Too much, probably.The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March and run out of gas.  The spread game is very different than playing crude.  These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made a penny.  Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?  That seems hard to believe.  slafontaine@globalp.com on 10/13/2000 09:42:43 AMTo: jarnold@enron.comcc:  Subject: mkts  cmon give me some credit-you think ive been doing this this long w/out knowwho's doing what! im i ny for the pira conference-thyre pretty bearish cal 01and 02-will be interesting to see if/when the producers start to take that toheart. here's one for you to think about... of pira's rite-ie production gonnabe up 1-1.5 bcf by year end. does increased deliverabilty mean these wintersprds in producing areas-ie jan-apr and the fact the mkts gonna be moreconcerened about running out in march than in jan suggest big invererese willnot be sustainable but will happen only on a weather event??? be curoius yourthots-i maybe thinking too much but makes some sense to me-have a good weekendjohnny.pira says decm 01 prod up 3 bcf y on y!

"Savita:A couple of issues: 1.  I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis child (grandchild).  Is this not currently allowed by the system? 2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they meant to trade nymex.  Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly.  Eventually I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm restricted right now by issue #1. Please advise,John"

Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment Structure STRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.

Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment Structure STRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction. LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced. All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse. USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period. EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds. The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement. Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint. CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.

We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 to a 41.67 heat rate.  We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.  Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.  What about a forecast for this November loads. Let me know what you think.   Phillip

"Z/F !!!!   wow.    Who would have thunk it.  Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as wide as last year.  Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip.  Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.   if it couldn't do it this year....A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve told them to do last bid week.  Obviously, more gas trying to come out than is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an Enron, to inject.  Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  Storage economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of winter.  Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways.  Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.  storage boys are withdrawing today and buying that.   bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it going to zero?  slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/22/2000 06:50:46 AMTo: John.Arnold@enron.comcc:  Subject: re:mkts  agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up buyingem back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time isbusy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you withcalls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have thetime. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways butone cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called impactof husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate atall-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon.   also will be curious how these ""loan deals"" by pipes work ouut. man theseguys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cashhasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in theback of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keepthat part of the curve very strong agree?  be cool my man-talk later  "

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn't enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South BayPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representativesin June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.    -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-LinePower Plants(This article was originally published Wednesday)    By Jessica Berthold   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) saidWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped bysome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimatereasons.The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's powergrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California PublicUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all powerplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW forunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.    AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict's"" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.    Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC Dynegy Inc.

(SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.    AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict's"" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.    Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc G_nther A.

The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by theElectricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01pounds a megawatt-hour.     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degreesto 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather ServicesCorp. in the U.S.     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.     December continued to fall amid a combination of positionclosing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand willnot rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds amegawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line withexpectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continueto stifle demand, traders said.     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds amegawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds amegawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds amegawatt-hour.     Open positions on many short-term structures will likelyforce many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures willprobably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can moreeasily be assessed. -Nick Livingstone Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast      Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power priceson the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher todayas colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede afterforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia fornext week. These producers typically generate power to preventreservoirs from overflowing.     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to risewith falling temperatures because of increased requirements forspace heating.     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in activetrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traderssaid.     ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" aStockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have beenselling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We shouldnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fallbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limitedchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to WeatherServices Corp. in the U.S.     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand wasexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predicttemperatures to begin falling.     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely riseby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-term contracts.     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner amegawatt-hour.     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, althoughexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producersto meet the increased demand, other traders said.     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who usedtoday's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. -Nick Livingstone-0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT=0F$  - daily.pdf"

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degreesFahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwesttemperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.     ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we weresupposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since theweather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from theEl Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.     ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power pricesto fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fellto $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plantwas shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduledto restart this weekend.     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday. -Robert Scalabrino PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas      Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-daypower prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-NewJersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts andfalling natural gas prices, traders said.     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at westernPJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with tradesranging from $62.00-$76.00.     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degreesFahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperaturescould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.     ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part ofthe morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expirationthe market had pretty much dried up.""     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the mainreason for the decline in spot market prices.     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to theNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per millionBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. SinceMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecastsindicated reduced utility load requirements.     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies theynormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weatherforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-$92.00.     ~-Karyn Rispoli Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices      Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continentnext-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revisedwarmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on theCincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as themarket opened down to $59.00 after options expired.     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power onthe Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 loweron average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17lower at $65.00-$100.00.     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predictedhigh temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normalin Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next sevendays, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulledprices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recentelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-firedgeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an averageof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million Britishthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an averageof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.     ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've gotpeople coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are muchmore realistic prices.""     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if theoutlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power fordelivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00yesterday.

"saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these guys are taking off the front, they are also buying back summer.  el paso large buyer of next winter today taking off spreads.  certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong on the way up and such a piece now.   really the only one left with any risk premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that has to be reflected in h/j.  slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/13/2000 04:15:51 PMTo: slafontaine@globalp.comcc: John.Arnold@enron.com Subject: re:spreads  mkt getting a little more bearish the back of winter i think-if we get anothercold blast jan/feb mite move out. with oil moving down and march closer flat pxwide to jan im not so bearish these sprds now-less bullish march april as well.

"Steve, I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.     As far as recommendations, here is a short list:  1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future       replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                    This creates a shortage in later months.  2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                        Specific questions should include:     1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage?   2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system.         I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less.  3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                     LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market and the      consumer has benefitted.   Call me if you need any more input. Phillip"

"Jim,  I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks.   I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you.  Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January. Phillip Allen"

"Questions about 12/29 rentroll:  There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?  Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For what periods?  What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off. I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this right?  Has the deposit been made yet?  A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly. Phillip"

"Lucy, Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather. You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  This needs to be handwritten on all new leases. I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write something today.  Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting. Phillip"

"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.  Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.   Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas:  1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.  2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November)      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 Phillip  "

"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City StarDate: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number.  The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.  ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas.""  But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality.  ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said.  As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street.  Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices.  ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.  In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.  Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes.  Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared.  ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.  But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.  ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.  Hot topic  Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed.  The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well.  The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.  ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said.  A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers.  But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter.  There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.  But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets.  ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.  Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world.  Setting the price  In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices.  The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use.  There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas.  But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time.  As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers.  Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter.  Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.  Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.  Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.  But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.  ""I was getting worried,"" he said.  Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.  Just passing through  Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers.  Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.  Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy.  Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter.  Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.  Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs.  On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.  ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.  Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.  But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.  ""I was getting worried,"" he said.  Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.  Just passing through  Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers.  Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.  Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy.  Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter.  Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.  Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs.  On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.  ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December (and maybe earlier). PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get some assurances of payment.  SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due on 2/2/01. For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this occurred today. Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it. "

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December (and maybe earlier). PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get some assurances of payment.  SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due on 2/2/01. For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this occurred today. Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it. "

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.  Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.   Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas:  1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.  2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November)      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 Phillip  "

Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under= such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV. Cost Containment InitiativesHighlightsSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital==20improvement component as follows (in millions):Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to==20be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=om=20contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the==20most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)Highlights:As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year.

Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20Our comments are summarized as follows:The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and= the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisHighlights:In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII. Earnings of California AffiliatesSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500==20million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.==20This increase correlates to the increase in market pricesfor natural gas for the same period.A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20www.cpuc.ca.gov.=20Dan "

Cost Containment InitiativesHighlightsSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital==20improvement component as follows (in millions):Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to==20be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=om=20contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the==20most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)Highlights:As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20Our comments are summarized as follows:The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and= the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisHighlights:In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII. Earnings of California AffiliatesSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500==20million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.==20This increase correlates to the increase in market pricesfor natural gas for the same period.A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20www.cpuc.ca.gov.=20Dan "

The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II. Credit RelationshipsHighlights:SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=lt.=20Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=nd=20payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond==20indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =its=20rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade==20issues within the last three weeks.III.

Thanks  Larry May@ENRON02/02/2001 02:43 PMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT@ECT, Errol McLaughlin/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: re: book admin for Pipe/Gas daily option book As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time fits in your schedules. Thanks, Larry  "
"Jacques, Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?   The key business points are: 1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million 3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5.  60/40 split favoring the investors. With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted. Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some tweaking.   Phillip Allen713-853-7041pallen@enron.com "

"Lucy, Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager. It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease. When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.   Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes if you need to.   Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to. It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I mean. Talk to you later, Phillip"

"Jaques, After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only true costs + 1.4 million. Phillip"

Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included. George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will review and let you know what I think. The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only true costs + 1.4 million. Phillip"

"John, Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim. Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen: 1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the        parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing        scheduling in Unify are grey. 2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further      scrutiny. 3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add    some value and direction to the group. In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD to work part time to get it done. Phillip"

"Lucy, Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll: #2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is not on any rentroll that I can see. #9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she will start paying on #9 #15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to collect the $95 in question. #33  Missed rent.  Are they still there? #26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits. #44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of the year. #33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit? The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to figure these out immediately. I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll in case you need to research these questions. I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679. Phillip"

"Don, I was out last week.  Regarding the Montana supply, you can refer them to Mark Whitt in Denver.   Let me know when you want to have the other meeting. Also, we frequently give out quotes to mid-marketers on Fred LaGrasta's desk or Enron marketers in New York where the customer is EES.  I don't understand why your people don't contact the desk directly. Phillip"

"George, I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million.  The components are as follows:  Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million  Land      1.15  Interim Financing     .85  Common Areas       .80  Total     $10.4 Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.   Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing. Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives. Phillip    "

"Darrell, Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like to proceed and develop the property.   My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would also like to compare construction and development services between what you can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about either. I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow. Phillip"

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000. I have summarized our issues as follows: 1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:      Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417 2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over. 3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI). 4.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000. I have summarized our issues as follows: 1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:      Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417 2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over. 3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI). 4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate. 5.

"Jacques, George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.   We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market.   My version of a buyout is attached. I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  Since their costand fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance.

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.?  Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.?  We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your   choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd.

Phillip Allen Keith Holst ENRON 1400 Smith Street Houston, TX? 77002-7361 Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout Dear Phillip and Keith:  We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.?  As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.?  Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.?  We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? If this is your   choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. Thank you. ? Sincerely, [IMAGE] ? ? ? George W.

"Jacques, George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.   We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market.   My version of a buyout is attached. I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  Since their costand fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance.

Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned. I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account? Thank you for looking into this issue. Phillip

"Greg, Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks? Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms. Phillip"

"Reagan,  Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.  Specific features include:  Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs Wood stairs Two story porches on front and rear Granite counters in kitchens and baths Tile floors in upstairs baths Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers) Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths Solid wood interior doors Windows fully trimmed Crown molding in downstairs living areas 2x6 wall on west side  Undecided items include:  Vinyl or Aluminum windows Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 sides   I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, but  only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.    Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a box with a simple roof  line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

"Greg, Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent? Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit. Why is profit only 4%?  Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K. What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us? Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan? What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage would only be 1.16. Talk to you this afternoon. Phillip "

I was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley. A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.

I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.

I was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley. A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  Morecabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.Reagansuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.

"Reagan, I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans?   Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:   5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment  2%- overhead  4%- profit I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas? I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week. Phillip   "

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available.  The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble.  If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage. The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.  (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)     "

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available.  The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble.  If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage. The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.  (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)     "

From:  Stephen Swain                           04/10/2001 11:58 AM	 To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris Mallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill Williams III/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: CAISO demand reduction Phillip et al., I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as compared with the previous year. Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable. Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer. I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any questions or need any further information."

From:  Stephen Swain                           04/10/2001 11:58 AM	 To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris Mallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill Williams III/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: CAISO demand reduction Phillip et al., I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as compared with the previous year. Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable. Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC (U.S.) summer load.

"Johnnie, Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor. I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built. Please email your cost estimates when complete. Thank you, Phillip Allen"

"Frank, The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.   Phillip"

I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps: Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.

Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?  Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps: Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

"Ned, Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid. Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only. I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments. Phillip Allen "

"Tim, Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract. On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight? Thank you, Phillip"

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack of SupportSources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult. The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward. Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 BLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B   Bear Stearns  $625 MTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:  5.38%Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510 Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.   The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments. "

However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward. Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 BLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B   Bear Stearns  $625 MTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:  5.38%Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510 Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.   The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments. "

If the legislature indicat=es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20 The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for= bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and= the DWR proportionately from rate payments. "

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peakpower dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causingprices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.     According to Weather Services Corp., of LexingtonMassachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 astraders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawattPalo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increasedproduction to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of ascheduled refueling outage that began March 31.     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak powerslumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to aBloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degreesFahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with coolingdemand 84 percent below normal.     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which iscausing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peakpower fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at$175.00-$228.00.     According the California Independent System Operator today'sforecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. -Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand      Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase inavailable generation coupled with less weather-related demand,caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as muchas 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degreeFahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating andcooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peakpower scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloombergvolume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 fromFriday.     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-basedtrader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need forheating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all weeklong.""     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000megawatts through Friday.     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause forthe dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned toservice today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected tohit the grid tomorrow.     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New YorkPower Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2nuclear power facilities.     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion ofa refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 atfull power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are ownedand operated by Niagara Mohawk.     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to$51.25 and $40.00 indices.     ~-Karyn Rispoli Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up      Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peakpower prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as highweather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,traders said.     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (TennesseeValley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergyto there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because ofthat.""     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesdayinto the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from theSoutheast was expected to remain high into next week.     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest ofthe week, because there's enough power to get down there but notso much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" anECAR trader said.     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand fromthe Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,though traders said transmission problems limited volume.     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at theChicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, withtrades from $32.00-$40.00.     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices alsoclimbed today, showing the largest increase in the region asabove-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problemsisolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northernMAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southernhalf of the region at $45.00-$52.00.     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees inMinneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problemsgetting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here anddown in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up      Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spotelectricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned tomajor Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based WeatherServices Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlantavicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather isexpected to begin Wednesday.     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Councilregional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour fromequivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded anaverage of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amidtrades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firmenergy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traderscomplained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with thesupply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power fortomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were doneat a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traderssaid forecasts for cooler weather through much of the Southstarting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at$35-$36.     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energyat $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region becausepower from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloombergindex of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for thebalance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though latertrades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergypower was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traderssaid.     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week wasbid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy forthe balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new tradeswere noted. -Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids      London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy sellinginterest, traders said.     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds amegawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, beforeclosing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower thanFriday.     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start ofthe month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from onetrading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it wasshort. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from oppositionfrom another trading house, which bought the contract, supportingprice levels, traders said.     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather wasexpected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower productioncosts because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday afterlast trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gasfutures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence sincethe start of last week.     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamentalreasons for price movements because of the immaturity of themarket, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,they said. -Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest      Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-termelectricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushedto buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amidlimited hydro-supply, traders said.     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an alltime high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; nowyou have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of thesnow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices aresteadily climbing.''     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percentabove normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""morerealistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wetoutlooks.''     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecationsof 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this wasa ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hourwith 140 megawatts exchanged.     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hoursgeneration, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours. -Alejandro Barbajosa-0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT=0F$  - daily.pdf"

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peakpower dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causingprices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.     According to Weather Services Corp., of LexingtonMassachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 astraders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawattPalo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increasedproduction to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of ascheduled refueling outage that began March 31.     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak powerslumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to aBloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degreesFahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with coolingdemand 84 percent below normal.     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which iscausing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peakpower fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at$175.00-$228.00.     According the California Independent System Operator today'sforecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. -Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand      Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase inavailable generation coupled with less weather-related demand,caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as muchas 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degreeFahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating andcooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peakpower scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloombergvolume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 fromFriday.     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-basedtrader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need forheating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all weeklong.""     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000megawatts through Friday.     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause forthe dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned toservice today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected tohit the grid tomorrow.     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New YorkPower Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2nuclear power facilities.     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion ofa refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 atfull power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are ownedand operated by Niagara Mohawk.     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to$51.25 and $40.00 indices.     ~-Karyn Rispoli Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up      Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peakpower prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as highweather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,traders said.     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (TennesseeValley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergyto there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because ofthat.""     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesdayinto the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from theSoutheast was expected to remain high into next week.     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest ofthe week, because there's enough power to get down there but notso much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" anECAR trader said.     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand fromthe Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,though traders said transmission problems limited volume.     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at theChicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, withtrades from $32.00-$40.00.     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices alsoclimbed today, showing the largest increase in the region asabove-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problemsisolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northernMAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southernhalf of the region at $45.00-$52.00.     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees inMinneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problemsgetting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here anddown in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up      Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spotelectricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned tomajor Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based WeatherServices Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlantavicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather isexpected to begin Wednesday.     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Councilregional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour fromequivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded anaverage of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amidtrades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firmenergy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traderscomplained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with thesupply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power fortomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were doneat a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traderssaid forecasts for cooler weather through much of the Southstarting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at$35-$36.     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energyat $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region becausepower from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloombergindex of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for thebalance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though latertrades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergypower was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traderssaid.     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week wasbid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy forthe balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new tradeswere noted. -Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids      London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy sellinginterest, traders said.     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds amegawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, beforeclosing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower thanFriday.     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start ofthe month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from onetrading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it wasshort. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from oppositionfrom another trading house, which bought the contract, supportingprice levels, traders said.     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather wasexpected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower productioncosts because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday afterlast trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gasfutures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence sincethe start of last week.     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamentalreasons for price movements because of the immaturity of themarket, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,they said. -Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest      Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-termelectricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushedto buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amidlimited hydro-supply, traders said.     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an alltime high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; nowyou have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of thesnow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices aresteadily climbing.''     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percentabove normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""morerealistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wetoutlooks.''     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecationsof 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this wasa ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hourwith 140 megawatts exchanged.     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hoursgeneration, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours. -Alejandro Barbajosa-0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT=0F$  - daily.pdf"

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peakpower dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causingprices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.     According to Weather Services Corp., of LexingtonMassachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 astraders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawattPalo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increasedproduction to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of ascheduled refueling outage that began March 31.     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak powerslumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to aBloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degreesFahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with coolingdemand 84 percent below normal.     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which iscausing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peakpower fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at$175.00-$228.00.     According the California Independent System Operator today'sforecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. -Robert Scalabrino Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand      Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase inavailable generation coupled with less weather-related demand,caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as muchas 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degreeFahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating andcooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peakpower scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloombergvolume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 fromFriday.     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-basedtrader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need forheating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all weeklong.""     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000megawatts through Friday.     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause forthe dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned toservice today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected tohit the grid tomorrow.     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New YorkPower Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2nuclear power facilities.     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion ofa refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 atfull power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are ownedand operated by Niagara Mohawk.     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to$51.25 and $40.00 indices.     ~-Karyn Rispoli Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up      Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peakpower prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as highweather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,traders said.     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (TennesseeValley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergyto there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because ofthat.""     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesdayinto the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from theSoutheast was expected to remain high into next week.     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest ofthe week, because there's enough power to get down there but notso much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" anECAR trader said.     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand fromthe Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,though traders said transmission problems limited volume.     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at theChicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, withtrades from $32.00-$40.00.     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices alsoclimbed today, showing the largest increase in the region asabove-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problemsisolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northernMAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southernhalf of the region at $45.00-$52.00.     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees inMinneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problemsgetting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here anddown in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."" -Ken Fahnestock Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up      Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spotelectricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned tomajor Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based WeatherServices Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlantavicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather isexpected to begin Wednesday.     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Councilregional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour fromequivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded anaverage of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amidtrades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firmenergy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traderscomplained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with thesupply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power fortomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were doneat a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traderssaid forecasts for cooler weather through much of the Southstarting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at$35-$36.     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energyat $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region becausepower from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloombergindex of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for thebalance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though latertrades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergypower was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traderssaid.     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week wasbid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy forthe balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new tradeswere noted. -Brian Whary U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids      London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy sellinginterest, traders said.     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds amegawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, beforeclosing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower thanFriday.     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start ofthe month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from onetrading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it wasshort. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from oppositionfrom another trading house, which bought the contract, supportingprice levels, traders said.     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather wasexpected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower productioncosts because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday afterlast trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gasfutures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence sincethe start of last week.     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamentalreasons for price movements because of the immaturity of themarket, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,they said. -Amal Halawi Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest      Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-termelectricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushedto buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amidlimited hydro-supply, traders said.     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an alltime high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; nowyou have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of thesnow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices aresteadily climbing.''     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percentabove normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""morerealistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wetoutlooks.''     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecationsof 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this wasa ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hourwith 140 megawatts exchanged.     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hoursgeneration, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours. -Alejandro Barbajosa-0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT=0F$  - daily.pdf"

Here are the main points from their conversation 1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it."" He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court."" 2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office. 3.	New Generator Construction Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer."""

We are hoping to  supplement EMF's list of economists and economic modelers who are  largely academics or with government labs or offices with folks from companies  who can help shed some light on how companies anticipate markets  will react to climate policies and the possible changes to prices and  availability of cleaner fuels such as natural gas.  A description of the  2-day program follows, and we can provide more information on the EMF meeting as  well if that's helpful.  I would be grateful if you can help identify  someone at Enron -- or otherwise -- who you feel could both contribute  to and benefit from the discussions with top economists and modelers.    If you need more information, please feel  free to call me or Leianne Clements (our economist) at the Pew Center number  listed below.   Thanks for considering,Vicki Arroyo CochranDirector of Policy Analysis      The Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change  Debate (August 9-10, 2001) Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG)  are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively  ""cleaner"" than burning coal and oil.   A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would  favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus  accelerating its demand.    However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed  results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to  more ""dirty"" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than  oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax).   The Pew Center has found that NG information is often  extrapolated from that of oil.   Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector,  policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change  problem.  The Pew Center will host a  conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University,  to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining  natural gas issues.  A report will  be published summarizing the topics discussed in the  conference.

"Carlos, Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.   Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.   I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below: Sales price:		2,100,000Purchase price		1,200,000Fees&Devel costs	  500,000 Profit			 400,000 The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan. I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange. I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify.   First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange? Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP. If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity? Thank you in advance for your help.

"John, Two items: 1.  I spoke to John McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.  2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues. 	"

"jeff, Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights. We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you. Thanks,Jeff"

The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions. The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations. The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists. ``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company. Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687. El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

(""OEI"") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as  Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001. Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784.   << File: OEI.xls >> "

"Michael, I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options.  Unfortunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future.  The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place.  They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options.   It was worth a try. Phillip"

Greg here are my questions regarding the cedar park deal.  
"10:30 (Dow Jones) The key to analyzing media stocks is....automobiles? Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts Ed Hatch, Peter Mirsky and Eric Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager. Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies ""to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports."" Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp. (NWS), and Disney (DIS). ( BS)"

"Jean, Congratulations on being team leader for the video.   Here are some ideas: 1.	A long winded VP drones on and on asking questions about an analyst that is not in his/her group while the camera flashes to other bored VP's.  It could start with sighs and rolling eyes then build to comical efforts to be put out of their misery. (gun to head or rope around neck)2.	Include some digs at John Lavorato's quirks like always pulling up his shirt sleeves. Just some ideas to get things started.  Obviously, the gas market is slow today. Phillip"

"Greg, This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San Marcos by unit.  Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom.  Let's compare numbers. Here is a list of questions: 1.	Unit mixes of all proposed projects.2.	Completion date of  Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. (186)3.	Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds?  This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005.  San Marcos will have over 6,000 units.  If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%.  That would not be a disaster. Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data. Let me know what you think. Phillip"

The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.

Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st.  We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st. We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available.  The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble.  If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

Every time we transact, ENA's Confirmation Group needs to know from whom to expect payment, i.e. San Diego Gas & Electric. The nature of the transaction exposes ENA to secondary risk with the ultimate counterparty. On another note, some transactions COULD be declined by Credit due to direct exposure/risk that the ENA has with the Counterparty, outside of any WMBE Transactions.  Sitara Deal Number 1014433 was another violation of Corporate Credit Policy. In the future, please contact Credit before transacting with any Credit Watch Counterparty. -Darren Vanek"

Political Update International US Arab allies (Egypt, Saudi, Jordan, Kuwait, UAE) walking a fine line.  Masses believe US got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Washington.  Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect ""state of confusion"" to exist for immediate period ahead. In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator.  Oil Politics OPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident ""relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves"" in oil policy."

"Kirk, I would modify this document slightly.  The first section is titled ""Introduction to Risk Management"" and the second section is ""Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products"".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.  You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.

"Greg, I went to the title company yesterday and as instructed by Irwin I signed t=he deed of trust, the promissory note for 8.4, and the subordination agreem=ent.  Can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates.  What w=ill happen at closing?  Is the major problem with the appraisal that since =the land was only appraised at 1,120,000 we would be required to contribute= an additional 180,000 in equity?  If so, that is not good.

I am in a balanc=ing act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is pe=rfected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to= get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means i=t will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for s=ignature and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to ma=ke sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know. I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal an=d gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built =is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $=1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in Ja=nuary.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top= of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to s=how an increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce ou=r overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost =and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall de=bt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a= greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be o=ut of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk be=ing short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have be=en working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effec=ts each change will have on your equity and return. We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have= had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the =overall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging wh=ich has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundat=ion/concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark. Th=us, overall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point. I am attempting to get with Irwin and Cheerie and seeing if we can get the =final Doc's put together.

We're not sure what's driving the day to day variation. Direct effects of recent precipitation, combined with some very big precip forecast errors, are part of the explanation, but there also appears to be something going on with management of the non-treaty storage that BPA's cached upstream in Arrow. We've been looking into that, and hope to get some news via Technical Management Team today. From a multi-purpose project manager's perspective, I think that current reservoir elevation is one or two feet too high, so I do expect drawdown by month end. I also suspect that there are some limits in the non-treaty storage approaching that require at least partial withdrawal. The net effect should be a rise in production-- no more downstream storage is available and upstream releases will increase, certainly by November 1, but probably earlier.

"A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included: 	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining). All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray  "
"Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment. We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now. If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com. Thank you for your support. Enron Global Technology   -----Original Message----- From: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration Sent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON Cc: Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses  Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already. Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses. To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com. IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center. We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com. Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.  Enron Messaging Administration"

Revenues from continuing operations were US$3.69 billion fo=r the third quarter of 2001 compared to US$6.73 billion in the same period =in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third qua=rter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US$85=4 million or US$0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions= and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for th=e third quarter of 2001 was US$2.18 billion, or US$0.68 per common share, c=ompared to pro forma net earnings of US$597 million, or US$0.19 per common =share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000.   In the quarter, in=cremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operat=ions(a) were comprised of: US$750 million (pre-tax) for excess and obsolete= inventory, primarily related to Optical Inter-City; US$767 million (pre-ta=x) for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer finan=cing; and US$380 million (pre-tax) primarily related to charges associated =with certain third party investments. The Company also recorded: a US$801 m=illion (pre-tax) charge for restructuring associated with the completion of= the workforce reductions and facilities closures announced in June 2001; a=nd a US$223 million (pre-tax) charge primarily related to the approximately= 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of its Photonics Components= business.   Including Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensat=ion from acquisitions and divestitures, and one-time gains and charges, Nor=tel Networks recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the third qu=arter of 2001 of US$3.47 billion or US$1.08 per common share.   ""Revenues f=or the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry a=djusted to new levels of spending,"" said John Roth, president and chief exe=cutive officer Nortel Networks. ""Our bottom line results reflected the impa=ct of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During th=e third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implemen=t its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The= Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive b=reak even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structu=re is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.""   Frank Dunn, =the Company's new president and chief executive officer effective November =1, 2001, said, ""Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organiz=ation to drive continued leadership across three businesses: Metro Networks=, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services an=d voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless N=etworks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product progra=ms continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading p=ortfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help= them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reduct=ions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of oppor=tunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 day=s included:         --  the First North American ILEC began the circuit to =packet         transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade         =softswitch;     --  Announced Metro DWDM wins in the United States, Europe =and         Japan;     --  Announced Multiservice backbone awards (ATM, IP,= MPLS) in         China, Germany and Asia;     --  Continued progress on 3G= Wireless Internet infrastructure         deployments and completed the fir=st commercial UMTS test calls         and the first CDMA2000 1X mobile IP c=all;     --  Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated  =       Layer 4-7 content switching capability on our Layer 2-3 Edge        = Switch Router; and     --  Completed hardware design, significantly advanc=ed software         integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX =        solution.""    As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects =to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion o=f its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reduction=s are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A =workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quart=er of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continu=e to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The numbe=r of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including= the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ul=timately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the =quarter, Frank Dunn said, ""We are extremely pleased with the results that h=ave been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a signifi=cant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operatio=ns. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by= completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which=, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operati=ons and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhan=ced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and action=s we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet i=s well positioned.""   ""While we believe we are beginning to see early indic=ations that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainabl=e levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the u=ncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wa=ke of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and bu=sinesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth qua=rter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,"" concluded Dunn.         R=evenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure reven=ues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third= quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada =and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline =in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Eu=rope. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, E=urope and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet= revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and =Latin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photon=ic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter co=mpared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was l=argely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-cit=y solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues decline=d 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Su=bstantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and st=rong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable decl=ines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wire=less OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on =October 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Netwo=rks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks wil=l evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning =in the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter =of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the Uni=ted States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States a=nd Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001,= revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$1=9.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuin=g operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or U=S$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 bill=ion, or US$0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in= 2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations=, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions= and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intang=ible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US=$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending= Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its c=ost structure. Compared to the Company's year-end 2000 cost structure, excl=usive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company's cost structure a=t the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billi=on.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was =approximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$=750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the exp=ected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Exclud=ing the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gro=ss margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compa=red to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expe=nses    Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses in the third =quarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market ad=justments and further decline in some of our of customers' financial condit=ion resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter rel=ated to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental prov=isions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared =to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Res=earch and development (""R&D"") expenses were US$808 million in the third qua=rter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments t=o drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the eliminat=ion of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001,= R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100= million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operation=s.

"Don't know if you saw this already.  Interesting. Ken Indigestion Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01  All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid.  Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen.  Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand.  Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much.   Addressing a Burning Issue If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.

Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems.  ""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas.""  Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day.  That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says.  But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules.  Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.  "

"I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions. I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow."

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=ercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on e=quity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=ected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge= of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=ertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio=ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since= September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost= of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra =operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses= will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress= on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =  Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=nt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   ""While we w=ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=estment activity slowed after September 11th,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. ""In light of =the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower= our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in= the economy.""   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a= year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127= million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=ear.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating= expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results ""=on a managed basis"" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of= $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and= therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.= Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc=ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due= primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the= company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=lio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax= ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate=ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=sts did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflec=t strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Re=sults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses =as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=gher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b=alances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues =to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Co=rporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m=illion a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million p=re-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.   =American Express Company (http://www.americanexpress.com ), founded in 1850=, is a global travel, financial and network services provider.

"Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided. Calculation of Receipt Point CapacityTopock  540 mmcf/dEhrenberg 1250 mmcf/dNeedles 800 mmcf/dWheeler 800 mmcf/d New Receipt PointsKramer Junction 200 mmcf/dHector Rd 50 mmcf/dBoth will be available around Feb 1 Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows CalculationCurrently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations. New Calculation, Changes and DisplayBased on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools. OFO DeclarationName changes from overnominationCan declare before any CycleProvide 2 hour noticePost on Gas SelectShow OFO Calculation on Gas Select WindowsReason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into systemCalculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO'sNow customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows. Scheduling Changes-Nov 1Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycleCopy confirmed nomsAll noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files. 2 Hour NoticeSocal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.   Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFONominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.Use Elapsed Pro-Rata RulesExpected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows: Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cutCycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cutCylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cutWindows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume. For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:          Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled VolumesCycle 1                                    Cycle 2Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4 In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th. Winter Balancing RulesEffective Nov 1-March 31No changes.All customers must comply.Minimum delivery requirements50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)70% of daily usage depending on storage level70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min90% of daily usage depending on storage level90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible, Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account. Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)Not subject to 70% and 90% rules. 2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count. Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement. Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month. OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)      "

"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.   Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

"Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset  DevelopmentLaura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-MarketFrank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.   There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.  Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

"Philip, What is going on down the street?  Curious to hear any perspectives you maywish to offer from the trading floor?  Enron stock is now lower than when Ijoined the company out of business school.  I imagine there are quite a fewnot so happy people these days.  We can relate somewhat over here at NPWwith a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago).  Knowingyou, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you downmuch.

"If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message. We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.   We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.   Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.   As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance.  For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."

"Phillip, This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference. As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.

The hearing will beon January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impressionthat yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball. On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some usefulsuggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the additionforward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the newspace.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and usethe new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off theexisting play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room thatis bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could beused for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you wouldnot have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert theplayroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you couldslope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place alarge dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as yourdrawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area belowthe addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to thedriveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the houseso that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchento the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, Ithink opening the dining room would be the better idea. I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested inexploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggestsomething in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want meto try and sketch out these ideas. Phillip      -----Original Message-----     From:   ""Robert W.

"Please review. =20 Greg, After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20 Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as= of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%= of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=f Enron Corp. common stock. There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".=  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every= share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=ction 6.3. The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of= distribution under each of the three interpretations:  Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1 Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=esRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,65810% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. = =20 In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the= same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=er. Sincerely, Phillip Allen   =20=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09"

It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as= of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%= of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=f Enron Corp. common stock. There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distrib=ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one pay=ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution. The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The val=ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".=  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every= share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=ction 6.3. The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of= distribution under each of the three interpretations:  Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1 Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=esRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,65810% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.

"[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	  November 16, 2001  		 	     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 		   Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	     Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	     Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	     Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	   Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	   Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	   Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	     Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

"Phillip, Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting: 1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into theKnowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type. 2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us contentfor these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early nextweek to gather content and a second meeting for review. 3. We will change ""Gas Daily Risk"" to ""Intra-Month Risk"" throughout thesimulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk? 4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problemswhere there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways tohedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oilvolumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

"Phillip, It will go along this lines: (Conservative) *****************************************************We pay ""0"" going forwardWe have already played 300K in 3Q2001Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit Enron Q1, 2002 Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use. This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales.  I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved. *********************************************************************** If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or				 2. Continue ""as is"" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around.  Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project. Sincerely, Yevgeny Frolov713-345-8250 w << File: BRM Cash Flow Cases.xls >>  << File: BRM Contingency Numbers Rev3.xls >> "
To Accenture: As discussed early today we hereby notify Accenture of 10 days notice of intent to terminate our Arrangement Letter for development of Basics of Risk Management.  The 10 days count down begins as of this evening. During these 10 days Accenture and Enron will review its position and attempt to find a solution for this project to go forward.  
"We will hold off transferring any physical positions desk to desk until the end of bidweek.  After NX1, we will transfer positions at a daily EOL Index mid price.

"Good morning, In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.   This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day.  If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate.  Thanks,Kam x3-5781"

"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.   Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.         Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan."

"David, For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.   Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.

Sent:	Monday, November 26, 2001 11:18 AMTo:	Oxley, DavidSubject:	RE: Answer  David, For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.   Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.

"The project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with Accenture in which Enron pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form.  This allows Accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door. The effort from the SME's should be complete by Christmas.  Please push forward with the review of the knowledge layer.

Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around.  Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.

"MichelleHere are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature). Sheri When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?
