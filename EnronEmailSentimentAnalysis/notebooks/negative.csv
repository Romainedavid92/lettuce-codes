"Let's meet at 4:00.  Vince J Kaminski06/01/2000 09:19 AMTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jim Schwieger/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: VaR John, We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues.The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a goodcandidate for a systematic review of the VaR process. It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative basis,jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a bigjump in VaR.This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, lookat column D. The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:  a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the                     code to review it.  b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can propose, is to develop for                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to review the fwd vol curve                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  it can be smoothed. Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings? Vince "

"Dave:I was thinking about our conversation yesterday.   If El Paso, absent this power deal, were to give us physical gas for 8 years discounted at their WACC in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ENE, is that transaction a mark-to-market gain for us?  If not, what's the difference in paying them with an asset rather than cash.  If it is a mark-to-market gain, isn't this a way to generate false P&L?John"

"Lucy, Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.  There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4.  #11 Missed on 2/2? 5.  #13 Missed on 1/26? 6.  #14  missed on 2/2? 7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8.  #20a missed on 2/2? 9.  #35 missed on 2/2? My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  You may have sent me a message over the ""chat"" line that I don't remember on some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today. I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet them?  If so, what did you think? Phillip"

"George, I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation.  Any day between March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference. Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.  The items I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just clarification of what was in a number.   Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow morning.   Phillip"
