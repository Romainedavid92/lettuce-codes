I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.   My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.</td>\n",

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project. I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation. Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan. Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&amp;L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.Ability to view change deal P&amp;L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, prior deal terms, and net P&amp;L affect of the change.Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.Benchmark positions in TDS.Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit and explicit position break out issues. -- Allan. PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport.

San MarcosThe property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is forsale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now. If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is notyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I willknow more on this question later today. Sincerely, George W.

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.   My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.  \n",

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project. I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.

       "13  ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/09/2000 02:00 PM --------------------------- Richard Burchfield10/06/2000 06:59 AMTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Beth Perlman/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list Phillip, Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project. I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.

San MarcosThe property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is forsale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now. If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is notyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I willknow more on this question later today. Sincerely, George W.

You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking &amp; Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.  All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking &amp; Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.

But adversity teaches         us more important lessons than prosperity.         So my bet is that 2001 and the upcoming 2002         will prove to be very educational--and in         ways that matter.

Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal Apte.Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months.I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category.  I just don't want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year. Call me with questions.(x37041) Phillip AllenWest Gas Trading   \n",

have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal Apte.Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months.I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category.  I just don't want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year. Call me with questions.(x37041) Phillip AllenWest Gas Trading   \n",

have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal Apte.Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months.I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category.  I just don't want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year. Call me with questions.(x37041) Phillip AllenWest Gas Trading   \n",

have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal Apte.Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months.I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category.  I just don't want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year. Call me with questions.(x37041) Phillip AllenWest Gas Trading   \n",

              For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market. Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.    I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning. Grigsby   \n",

So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:- +\\tInfrastructure\\t\\tJenny Rub+\\tDevelopment\\t\\tJay Webb+\\tEnronOnline\\t\\tWebb / Forster+\\tHR\\t\\t\\tDavid Oxley+\\tCash Management\\tTom Myers+\\tCredit\\t\\t\\tDebbie Brackett The rest will be completed shortly. We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans \"Re-start/Integration\"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.  All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.   Parking & Transportation Desk3-7060   \n",

Phillip; Could you please e-mail me the draw file you created for Bishops Corner.  Iwas working on submitting it to you and rather then recreate it I shouldjust have you send it back to me to fill in the new draw totals. Also, I need the vendor payee list that you created for the Land and Softcosts. I need to re-format it by draw number and to the Bank One format, andagain it would be easier to get it from you then to re-create it. Please take a look at the following summary and compare to your numbers tosee if you agree. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLand And Soft Costs \\t- \\tInitial Draw\\t$\\t  1,608,683.05\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGalaxy\\t\\t\\t-\\tDraw # 1\\t$\\t     250,000.00\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGalaxy\\t\\t\\t-\\tDraw # 2\\t$\\t     223,259.09 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTotal Paid To Date Cash\\t\\t$\\t  2,081,942.14 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProject Cost\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t10,740,980.87\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLoan Amount\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t  8,055,736.65 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEquity Required\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t  2,685,244.22\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDeveloper Profit\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t (   326,202.57) \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBalance Of Funding\\t\\t\\t$\\t  2,359,041.65 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTotal Paid To Date\\t\\t\\t$\\t  2,081,942.14 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBalance To Fund Cash\\t\\t\\t$\\t     277,099.51 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGalaxy\\t\\t\\t-\\tDraw # 3\\t$\\t     467,566.66 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBank One Draw # 1\\t\\t\\t$\\t     190,467.15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFinal Cash Funding\\t\\t\\t$\\t     277,099.51 I think you thought you had more to fund.

I am working all day Monday so I hope I can get it before then ifpossible. Thanks A Lot Greg Thorse     \n",

But adversity teaches         us more important lessons than prosperity.         So my bet is that 2001 and the upcoming 2002         will prove to be very educational--and in         ways that matter. Here's what I learned this         year, as I saw technology--and the world--change         for good. http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1231/2835136:8593142 # _____________________NEWS ANALYSIS_____________________ Sylvia Carr     P2P: NOW FOR BIZ...

NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) \\tRe-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)\\t\\t\\t\\tTo be forwarded to Louise\\t\\tThese plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  \\tThe current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.\\t(ii)\\tBudget (due Jan 3, 2002)\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTo be forwarded to Faith Killen \\tFirst year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)(iii)\\tSeating Plans\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTammy Shepperd to co-ordinate\\tWe need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.\\tI have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.(iv)\\tDue Diligence\\tWe continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year Louise   \n",

MORE JOBS IN 2002... CABLE WOES PERSIST...     Could Microsoft be stalling? The nine    states still pursing the software giant's    antitrust case sure think so. They've    asked a federal judge to reject Microsoft's    request to delay the remedy hearings,    though Microsoft says any holdup is    the states' fault for seeking such a    tough remedy. http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1231/2835380:8593142   _____________________EXPERT ADVICE_____________________ Stephan Somogyi   A LOOK AHEAD: HOW 5 TECHNOLOGIES WILL FARE IN 2002    2001 was a great year for tech, but what about         this coming year?

You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking &amp; Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.  All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking &amp; Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.

But adversity teaches         us more important lessons than prosperity.         So my bet is that 2001 and the upcoming 2002         will prove to be very educational--and in         ways that matter.

Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal Apte.Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months.I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category.  I just don't want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year. Call me with questions.(x37041) Phillip AllenWest Gas Trading   \n",

have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal Apte.Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months.I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category.  I just don't want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year. Call me with questions.(x37041) Phillip AllenWest Gas Trading   \n",

have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal Apte.Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months.I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category.  I just don't want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year. Call me with questions.(x37041) Phillip AllenWest Gas Trading   \n",

have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal Apte.Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for the first 9 months.I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent category.  I just don't want Vishal to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year. Call me with questions.(x37041) Phillip AllenWest Gas Trading   \n",

              For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market. Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.    I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning. Grigsby   \n",

So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:- +\\tInfrastructure\\t\\tJenny Rub+\\tDevelopment\\t\\tJay Webb+\\tEnronOnline\\t\\tWebb / Forster+\\tHR\\t\\t\\tDavid Oxley+\\tCash Management\\tTom Myers+\\tCredit\\t\\t\\tDebbie Brackett The rest will be completed shortly. We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans \"Re-start/Integration\"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.  All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.   Parking & Transportation Desk3-7060   \n",

Phillip; Could you please e-mail me the draw file you created for Bishops Corner.  Iwas working on submitting it to you and rather then recreate it I shouldjust have you send it back to me to fill in the new draw totals. Also, I need the vendor payee list that you created for the Land and Softcosts. I need to re-format it by draw number and to the Bank One format, andagain it would be easier to get it from you then to re-create it. Please take a look at the following summary and compare to your numbers tosee if you agree. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLand And Soft Costs \\t- \\tInitial Draw\\t$\\t  1,608,683.05\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGalaxy\\t\\t\\t-\\tDraw # 1\\t$\\t     250,000.00\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGalaxy\\t\\t\\t-\\tDraw # 2\\t$\\t     223,259.09 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTotal Paid To Date Cash\\t\\t$\\t  2,081,942.14 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProject Cost\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t10,740,980.87\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLoan Amount\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t  8,055,736.65 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEquity Required\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t  2,685,244.22\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDeveloper Profit\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t$\\t (   326,202.57) \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBalance Of Funding\\t\\t\\t$\\t  2,359,041.65 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTotal Paid To Date\\t\\t\\t$\\t  2,081,942.14 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBalance To Fund Cash\\t\\t\\t$\\t     277,099.51 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGalaxy\\t\\t\\t-\\tDraw # 3\\t$\\t     467,566.66 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBank One Draw # 1\\t\\t\\t$\\t     190,467.15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFinal Cash Funding\\t\\t\\t$\\t     277,099.51 I think you thought you had more to fund.

I am working all day Monday so I hope I can get it before then ifpossible. Thanks A Lot Greg Thorse     \n",

But adversity teaches         us more important lessons than prosperity.         So my bet is that 2001 and the upcoming 2002         will prove to be very educational--and in         ways that matter. Here's what I learned this         year, as I saw technology--and the world--change         for good. http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1231/2835136:8593142 # _____________________NEWS ANALYSIS_____________________ Sylvia Carr     P2P: NOW FOR BIZ...

NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) \\tRe-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)\\t\\t\\t\\tTo be forwarded to Louise\\t\\tThese plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  \\tThe current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.\\t(ii)\\tBudget (due Jan 3, 2002)\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTo be forwarded to Faith Killen \\tFirst year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)(iii)\\tSeating Plans\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTammy Shepperd to co-ordinate\\tWe need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.\\tI have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.(iv)\\tDue Diligence\\tWe continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year Louise   \n",

MORE JOBS IN 2002... CABLE WOES PERSIST...     Could Microsoft be stalling? The nine    states still pursing the software giant's    antitrust case sure think so. They've    asked a federal judge to reject Microsoft's    request to delay the remedy hearings,    though Microsoft says any holdup is    the states' fault for seeking such a    tough remedy. http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1231/2835380:8593142   _____________________EXPERT ADVICE_____________________ Stephan Somogyi   A LOOK AHEAD: HOW 5 TECHNOLOGIES WILL FARE IN 2002    2001 was a great year for tech, but what about         this coming year?
