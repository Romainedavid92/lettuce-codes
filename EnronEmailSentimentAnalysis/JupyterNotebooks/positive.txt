"Folks, I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime anddevelopment of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that Ithink will be interesting to the group. I highly recommend David Moore's book ""The Roman Pantheon"" at $25.00  -   avery thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....limeand clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The bookcovers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete. I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 yearslearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that havelasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and goodbackground information for sustainable builder folks. Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.  <A HREF=""http://www.romanconcrete.com/"">Roman Concrete Research by DavidMoore</A> Regards, Harry Francis"

"$100 for the yard seems like enough for up to 12.5 hours.  How long did it take him?  I think $100 should be enough.  Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if you want to change from printing vertically to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print previewto see what your print out will look like before you print. The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very highfor the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down. Glad to hear about the good deposit for this week.  Great job on February. Phillip"

Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if you want to change from printing vertically to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print previewto see what your print out will look like before you print. The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very highfor the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.

"Andy:Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  First, what happens if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on EOL?  Second, what strike are straddles traded at.  Are they set at the nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote?"
"Andy:The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.  Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money.  Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves. In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction."

What are typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity. As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are there elements that you would like to see?

"Jeff:Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit confused by the question. In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.  Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very favorable.I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level.John"

"Mary, If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6 or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.  12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.

"Scott,  I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more. Phillip"

"Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.  Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.  If we get two low injections, watch out.    	Enron North America Corp.		From:  Frank Hayden @ ENRON                           07/12/2000 04:39 PM	 To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Market Opinion about AGA's 	 John,I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears.  In the beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull case.  The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under stored.  I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change that expectation.  However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news. At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come from the physical market and weather.  I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue. Thanks,Frank     "

The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based ventureinitiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to golive soon afterwards.   While market transparency will increase as dealers used toover-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, usersof the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, JeffreySprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.   ""As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals bothcounterparties,"" he said. ""The real strength is that you (still) get theability to manage your own counterparties.   ""You can list all of the people you want to do business with and putin the credit terms under which you will do business.""   This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a""giant matrix"" within the system.   ""(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't surethey have ever seen the entire market,"" he said.   ""(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals youcan't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market.""   Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currentlyaware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase markettransparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers whofall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.   The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clockand will be accessible via the public internet or a private networkconnection.   Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco<BPA.L>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan StanleyDean Witter <MWD.N>, Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS><SHEL.L>, Societe Generale<SOGN.PA> and TotalfinaElf <TOTF.PA>.   Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operationand Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominantinternationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.   Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and powercompanies, American Electric Power <AEP.N,> Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy<UCU.N,> Duke Energy <DUK.N,> El Paso Energy <EPG.N>, Reliant Energy<REI.N> and Southern Company Energy Marketing <SO.N>.   Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact thatthe founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and willface additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment totrade a minimum volume.    TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING   As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believestrading over the Internet could boost trading profits.""The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that apaperless back office can really save a lot of money,"" he said.   However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off giventhat dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearingsystems, as they do in current OTC systems.   Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties willreceive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through thoseplayers' own risk management systems.   But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its ownclearing system.  ""No one really knows how at the moment,"" Sprecher said. ""There mightbe some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now existspeer to peer.""  In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurredexcept those associated with trading. Membership is open to anycommercial market participant.   Each product will have its own published commission schedule, whichSprecher assessed at ""slightly below the best prices someone would payin the voice broker business"".

Enron has given permission for this firm to handle this, but they need further approval from each one of you to deal with your backoffice people and with your assistants in compiling this information to complete their project.  Below is a more detailed letter from the firm explaining their work here. Please respond to me that I have your approval to give for them to complete your project. Thank You, Ina Rangel---------------------- Forwarded by Ina Rangel/HOU/ECT on 08/22/2000 01:56 PM --------------------------- Sarah Bolken@ENRON08/22/2000 08:17 AMSent by: Sara Bolken@ENRONTo: Ina Rangel/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: ENA Fileplan Project Ina, here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project: We are records and information management consultants from Millican & Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we're taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff. There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be maintained. Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and then use the ""imaged"" document viewable from your computer as the working copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements.  During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.  If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.  Thank you. Sara BolkenX35150 "

"Just some feedback on our EOL discussion.  Whalley had similar thoughts about how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which system you like better. Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will be implemented shortly. I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 2-ways and killing the broker markets.  "

"Please take me off your email list  Jennifer Green <jgreen@aedc.org> on 09/01/2000 02:50:03 PMTo: ""AEDC Members"":;cc:  Subject: data standards Dear AEDC Member, One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arenais the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.  Thisstandard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economicdevelopers and their customers to have one common means of presenting andexamining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings andmore effective economic development decisions as communities will be morecomparable than ever before. A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it tosee how the data standards can be made to work for you.  There are 25tables in the standard presented in an excel format.  The tabs at thebottom of the page will access the additional tables. You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can usethe services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered intoa strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary forthe standards.  ACN will provide data and provide future updates of thestandard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to whichapproach works best for you. Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economicdevelopment profession.  They should be of particular advantage to the manyareas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven'treceived the consideration they deserve.  The standards are a great way totell their story. If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look fornotices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on thestandards and their use.

This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.

Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.

The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.

Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

"Ben:Jeff Shankman gave me your name.  I have assumed Jeff's old responsibilities as head of the natural gas derivatives trading group.  Our broker, EDF MAN, supplies us with $50 million of margin financing every night.  They are trying to clean up their books for end of quarter and/or year on Sep 30.  They have asked if we can post the $50 million overnight on the 30th.  We did this last year as well.   Please advise,John"
"I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there.  Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.   Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car thief. From: Margaret Allen@ENRON on 09/27/2000 08:24 AMTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Commercials   So, what did you think?!

The first two commercials were supposed to be idealistic spots announcing Enron as an innovative company, while the next four are proof points to our innovation by showing the businesses we have created.  I know you were elated to get an email from me this morning, thus proving that I had not been kidnapped and all those important things I work on would continue to be completed.  Oh and that certainly is a pretty design you add to your emails.  Very masculine!

Jim:I apologize for the comment after your order.  I knew you didn't like the market last night so I was surprised when you were an buyer this morning.  It's not your style to change views quickly as you tend to trade with a longer term view.   I was out of line with the comment and it won't happen again. John
"Liane,  As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.  We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.

We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:  1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.   2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.

Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index.

From: Margaret Allen@ENRON on 09/27/2000 01:45 PMTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: Commercials   John, John, John....very impressive analysis!  The first two commercials were supposed to be idealistic spots announcing Enron as an innovative company, while the next four are proof points to our innovation by showing the businesses we have created.  I know you were elated to get an email from me this morning, thus proving that I had not been kidnapped and all those important things I work on would continue to be completed.  Oh and that certainly is a pretty design you add to your emails.  Very masculine!

The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there.  Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.   Sorry I ruined your run.

"Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.   One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec Nymex.  Any ideas?"
"Russell:I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as someone ""who thinks outside the box"".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.  As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade counterparty. I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.   Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.Thanks, John"

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now. If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is notyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I willknow more on this question later today. Sincerely, George W.

"Mark:We are still on for drinks on the 19th.  You have called the market very well since you started sending me updates.  Unfortunately for both of us, a couple of good calls does not a soothsayer make.  Thus, keep sending me your updates so I can at least get a little broader judgment of your abilities.   In terms of my trading style, I take positions to make $.25-$1, not $.05.  Too much noise in this market to trade differently for me.

Myshort-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and naturalappears to be waning at present. Volume on this rally is  poor,particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside. The  marketappears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels. If  weare at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would beextremely  bullish. Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not sogreat.   Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural. Bigger pictureis still  very bullish. However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks ofwhat I would  call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big moveto the  upside. Let me know if this stuff is useful for you.

"Adam:Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.  It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Whenyou talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towardsEnron Online, or are you doing trading outside of EnronOnline?  I think the underlying question that I am asking,is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,or is it meant to bypass traders completely. Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forwardto talking with you again when you come to campus forinterviews.

"Hey:I hope you know we were just kidding with you yesterday.  We don't get many strangers on the floor so we have to harass them when we do.   I think I am a couple of the ""we are not"" attributes in your book.  Is that going to cause me any problems going forward? John"

"Hey:Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.  Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.  interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.  definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one year ago and not a significant loss of demand.   market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.  Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 considering the scenario that's being painted.     slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/21/2000 01:06:40 PMTo: jarnold@enron.comcc:  Subject: re:mkts  johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating forme-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled allthe rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gastherefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was longmar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early  flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep aflaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustainedaboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.    but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to marksilverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve noidea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. anygreat insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.   guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling dryup??

I do appreciate your offer but I don't want to take away from the amazing year you've had so far.  Maybe you should come trade this...John  Jim Schwieger12/06/2000 05:42 PMTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: For What It's Worth. Through the year's (Sounds like Im really old) I have learned that the really great Individuals come down on themselves for circumstances beyond their control when in fact their performance is far beyond what anyone else could have done.  I believe you are one of those individuals.  I appreciate what you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on.  This especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3 months.  You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX liquidity to cover your risk.  I would like to offer to transfer $30 million out of the Storage Book to the Price Book.  Without you and EOL I could never have done what I've done.   Thanks,   Jim Schwieger "
don't know.  think a little bit of everyone as the storage guys own it all.  slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/05/2000 09:37:01 AMTo: jarnold@enron.comcc:  Subject: mar/apr  im so sick for getting out of that-john who 's getting squeezed on the mar? hopeits not you. pretty sure it isnt so safe to ask you?  
seems crazy.  if you're willing to ride it for a few cents against you it's a great trade.  who knows where they're going in th eshort term though  slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/01/2000 09:57:30 AMTo: John.Arnold@enron.comcc:  Subject: re:summer inverses  johnnny-you think these inverses ready to get sold yet? to me its all a timingissue but aug/oct at 4-5 cts seems rich rich for injection season. only issue iswhen to go?  
"i think it is something we need to do.  please set it up  Caroline Abramo@ENRON11/14/2000 11:06 AMTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT Subject: microphone to houston John-  What do you think of getting a direct mic from New York to Houston as soon as possible?  We had one at my last employer from NY to London which worked great.  You can tun it on or off but it allows us to communicate without getting on the darn phone - I am sure its a total annoyance to pick us up. The steno is still a phone to me and its not recorded.  We could keep it between you and Mike.  We are getting a few more funds to trade now- some program guys among them who will need quicker execution.  I know you and Per have discussed the idea of them calling you direct but I think, for now, the mic is a better answer.  I can sit down with you when I am down there to discuss and give you an update of who we are planning to trade with. Best Rgds,Caroline   "
"A funny story:Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the exchange stopped trading for an hour.  Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange closing.  One yelled at Rappaport...""Why don't you take your million dollar bonus and go buy Enron stock"""

"amazing how with cash futures at $1 and the back such a piece that f/g under such pressure.  month 2 has been the strongest part of the board all year.   will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt.  could j actually be strong?  seems like of the spreads on the board the best risk reward is in f/g.  a little worried about having the z/f effect again.  that is, all spec length trying to roll and funds trying to roll  at the same time leading to some ridiculous level at expiry.  any thoughts?  slafontaine@globalp.com on 12/08/2000 12:05:54 PMTo: John.Arnold@enron.comcc:  Subject: re:summer inverses  i suck-hope youve made more money in natgas last 3 weeks than i have. mkt shudbe getting bearish feb forward-cuz we already have the weather upon us-fuelswitching and the rest shud invert the whole curve not just dec cash to jan andfeb forward???? have a good weekend john  "

"Jeff, Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility connections?  Other rezoning costs?   What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can. Phillip"

"Gentlemen,  I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing, I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.  I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I hope to pull that together this afternoon.  I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss these procedures in advance.  Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur. Phillip"

In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments: Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This was a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be able to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today. "

Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments: Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This was a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be able to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today. "

"Jeff, That is good news about Leander.   Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have about $225K invested in the stagecoach,  it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.   I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee and Jaques Craig can work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.Checkout this spreadsheet.   These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the time and I don't trust Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from now on.

"Jeff, Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below. My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. Sales Price  705,000 1st Lien   473,500 2nd Lien  225,000 Transfer fee    7,500 Cash required   14,500 NOI   100,000 1st Lien    47,292 2nd Lien   23,694 Cash flow  29,014 Cash on cash  200% These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price. Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know. Phillip"

"George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.  The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.   I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.  Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.  pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work) Phillip Allen PS.  Channel 2 in Houston ran a story yesterday (Feb. 2) about a home in Kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls.  You should try their website or call the station to get the full story.  It would makes a good case for breathable walls."

"Lucy, Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The other questions I had about last week's rent are: #15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is going on? #25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.   Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.   Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time.  We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend. Phillip "

It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time.  We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend. Phillip "
"Lucy, Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The other questions I had about last week's rent are: #15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is going on? #25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.   Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.

"Jeff, I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns.   What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list. Email or call  me later today. Phillip "

"Jeff, My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I would net around $20K cash.   You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. Phillip"

"Lucy, Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35. But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and send it back. Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.  I will probably send you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.  Let's get this stuff clean today. Phillip"

The spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles.  Would you consider placing several spinning bikes out with the other exercise equipment and running a spinning video on the TV's.  I think the equipment would be used much more.  Members could just jump on a bike and follow the video any time of day. Let me know if this is possible. Phillip AllenX37041

"Gentlemen, Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed.   We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that.   Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used. Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project. Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward. Phillip"

"Jacques, I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear this up. Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean.  What is your inclination? Call as soon as you have a chance to review. Phillip"

"In regards to your E-mail, I have recently been informed by Nicole that she will be leaving Enron effective April 30.  This is unfortunate because she has been a very valuable member of our team over the last few years and has been instrumental in developing the Eastern Rockies trading business and providing our customers with excellent service.  Nicole is not leaving to go to a competitor, but is going to spend more time with her family.  Given this fact, you probably want to speed up the transition.  Call me and we can discuss. Mark  	Jay Reitmeyer@ECT	03/16/2001 09:04 AM		 		 To: Paul T Lucci/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Whitt/NA/Enron@Enron, Nicole Cortez/NA/Enron@Enron, Theresa Staab/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mike Grigsby/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT		 cc: Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT@ECT		 Subject: Denver trading I would like to welcome Susan Scott to the West Desk and specifically to the Eastern Rockies trading region.  The plan is for Susan to work with me in moving the day trading activities from the Denver office to Houston.  Her specific goals will be to take over activities performed by Nicole and Theresa while generating EOL products with me and in my absence. Susan is currently learning how to use EOL and Sitara.  She is also working on understanding the grid and the relationship between all the different trading points from Opal to the mid-continent. My plan is to have Susan go to the Denver office during May bid-week (April 22 - April 24).  I want her to be sitting with Nicole and Theresa during bid-week to see and learn everything they do during that time.  I will probably want Nicole and Theresa to come to Houston one more time to sit with us and the logistics team, maybe in early May.  Then, Susan and I will both go to Denver in late May or early June to meet industry people and to complete the transfer of operations to the Houston office. We can finalize these plans early next week and make all the corresponding reservations. Thank you, Jay"

I will be in San Marcos and you can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com. I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a check and give him the green light to file for replatting.  What will change if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change what he is going to submit to the city. I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the week.  I don't know who needs this report.

I will be in San Marcos and you can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com. I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a check and give him the green light to file for replatting.  What will change if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change what he is going to submit to the city. I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the week.  I don't know who needs this report.

"Jacques, The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required.  Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less. Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.   The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. Phillip"

"Jacques, Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only paymentthat George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the engineer.I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership.   I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership. Let me know what you think. Phillip"

"Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a list of questions on the specs: 1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or Cellulose? 5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet. 9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work. 10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2. 12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron railings? 15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except for change orders? I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to call Cary Kipp tosee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas. PhillipI  "

"Cary, Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.   A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch would be smaller. I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.

"Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the floor plan.He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through that day?  Also can you provide some references? Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust your bid.

"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.   My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time."

Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly. Phillip"

"Jeff, I received the fax from Velasquez Masonry for $11,000.  He is proposing to do work on nine buildings.  From the memo from the city it sounds like 33,34,35, and 42 are the units that are at risk for collapse.  I don't want to pay for any discretionary work.  Also, I am still waiting for a quote from another mason.   I am willing to offer $5,000 toward the repair and removal of rock in return for the release prepared by Jacques.  With regard to the utilities I want to have them transferred on Monday the 21st.  That will be one month that the utilities have been in my name.  It needs to be clear that I will net that month's electric and water against the $5,000 for the rock. If she is willing to take the money for repairs we should be able to wrap things up immediately.  If not we will have to continue negotiations, but the utilities still need to be transferred. Phillip"

"Adrianne, Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, Emil Carlsson and Thomas Considine. Emil is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position.  I would recommend bringing Emil to Houston for further interviews based on his technical knowledge.  The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation. Thomas was working as an equity market maker.  He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise.  He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades.  The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires.  I would also recommend bringing Thomas to Houston for further consideration. Phillip"
"John, Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this.  However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime. I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.   I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation. Please consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning. Phillip     "

"Jeff,  The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20. Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I have not received payment on either. Let's try and wrap this up this week.

"Jeff, I don't understand what you want me to do with this letter.  Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name. In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday. I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.  As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand. I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.

"Jacques, Have you received the assignment letter from Marcus Kolb.  This letter makes it sound like the assumption is just between the Kuo's and Success Real Estate.

"Greg, I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.  =First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, p=art of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for ""seniors"".  I would l=ike to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assist=ed living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I hav=e mentioned,  my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over th=e next two years.  At the current rate that amount would cover the equity r=equirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest p=artner like Keith. Here is the article: Sector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  H=ome and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised futu=re land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San Marcos Ci=ty Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two =Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 squa=re mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable a=nd appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affe=cting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corne=r of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  We=atherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of vari=ous city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner say=s were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two =plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no dir=ect effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density resid=ential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of= commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven a=dditional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight a=cres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is su=ggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing= development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of co=mmercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to ""community commerci=al"" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ens=ure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete wit=h buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed t=o separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan. = However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew som=e concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may po=se on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing th=e proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Ave=nue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the= plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron= Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between= the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughso=n supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sect=or Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in th=e area as development proceeds.  ""I'd rather say ""no' and if someone comes =us with a really good idea, look at it then,"" Hughson said.  Councilman Ed =Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of th=e curb cut.  ""It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happe=n there,"" Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclud=e curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San =Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting =against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the= meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from severa=l residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good =compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active crit=ic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concernin=g the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests =of the city as a whole.  ""This is not a victory for one side or the other,""= said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to= Weatherford's initial plans for his property, ""but a victory for the City =of San Marcos. We started out with all R-1...we've come a long way."" =09=20"

"Kay, I sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks.  The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.  I had lost your email so I sent it to Gary and asked him to forward it to you.  I guess he is technology challenged.  The article was just one analyst's opinion.  He can find dozens of articles just like it online.  It was not important. On a different note, Kelsey is at T Bar M camp this week.  Heather is very anxious about this.  The only info we get is through the camp's website.  Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day.  We scan through to try and spot Kelsey.  So far we have found her in one picture each day.  It is kind of fun trying to find her.  If you want to give it a try, go to their website at  www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml> .  Click on sports camp parent connection.  There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.  See if you can find her. Pat and Gary's house looks like it is taking shape fast.  The Meckels seem to do good work.  I might have to reconsider using them for our house.We should be in town Friday.  We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.  See you soon.

"John, I am going to miss the meeting with Vladi about Z6 and weather hedges.  I have been planning to be on vacation on August 1st -August 3rd and we are driving this afternoon before the kids get too cranky. I went over the analysis with Vladi.  It still seems that the bias of the weather products towards an above normal winter and the averaging vs event nature of the weather options keep them from being an effective hedge for Z6. See you on Monday. Phillip"

"Richard, I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?   Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference. Thank you for your help. Phillip Allenpallen@enron.com713-853-7041"
"Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the samelevel of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. Yousay that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. Ijust did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel costwas about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and wecan discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of thetrue custom home level but should be achievable with good management.Richard MorganManager, Green Building ProgramAustin Energy721 Barton Springs Rd.Austin, TX 78704-1194Ph. 512.505.3709Fax 512.505.3711e-mail richard.morgan@austinenergy.com -----Original Message-----From: Allen, Phillip K.

To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.   The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.  "
"Phillip/Tim/YevgenyPlease review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable. Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc 	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before) Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule.  Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock.  Thanks.

You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy =players just like yourself!   =09   Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I= start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te=rry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=r - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai=nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=nd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously= not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t=o go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=nswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=ina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but= Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at= best, so our hands are tied.  =09   Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players= like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=ig game.  =09   Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers= will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=ntasy player.  =09     Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=fter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes= will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09   This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

"The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.   As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

"Phillip, Which one should I do, the 8x12 is half the price.

We pretty much make whatever you would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only charged for the materials. Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually varies between $800 and $900.  Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be roughly $1500. We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time. If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364	My Home number 715-985-3063. Have a good one and take with you later. Sincerely, Mel Nelson"

Your dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be roughly $1500. We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time. If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364	My Home number 715-985-3063. Have a good one and take with you later. Sincerely, Mel Nelson"

"Gentlemen Good day. I hope all is going well.  If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance (see below). This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable.  Good news is that this deliverable and the Topic Framework deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. Thanks CheersKirk---------------------- Forwarded by Kirk McDaniel/HOU/EES on 10/23/2001 03:35 PM --------------------------- Kirk McDaniel10/19/2001 08:27 AMTo:	Phillip K Allen/Enron@EnronXGate, Tim O'Rourke/Enron@EnronXGate, Yevgeny Frolov/Enron@EnronXGatecc:	Ed McMichael/Enron@EnronXGate, Dutch Quigley/Enron@EnronXGate Subject:	Revised High Level Design-Sign-off for Acceptance Phillip/Tim/YevgenyPlease review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable. Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc 	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before) Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule.  Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock.  Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available. Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows:  1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.  This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.  If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.    "

"Phillip & Keith Attached is the first draw request, I will need some of these funds immediately. I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.  Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed. Additionally, it is getting close to closing. I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible. We can handle this in two ways. I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).

Read his column, Engel's Beat, every Tuesday in our Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar) for timely tips that could put your team over the top.

Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	   Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	   Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	   Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	     Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.  	   This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

"Richard, I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included.  So that reduces some of the savings.  Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.  Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.   Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.  I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.  What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?  Radiant barrier?  More attic ventilation?   Thank you for your help.

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I candecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprintscompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof. I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio thatis also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay withinthat budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick builthouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of aradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the sameenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke toa sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additionalcosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would helpme construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid fromWink with Premier based on you reference. Thank you for your help.

We need to get yourapproval of the points listed below so that we can begin building theapplication. We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner'sdecisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward intime with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners""more rope"" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order toachieve this, we will have the following constraints:   The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday's   meeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L and   positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous   period. We will not, for example, be able to say things like ""In   November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw   gas. What you should have done was...""   We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if the   learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences   a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to   start over at time period one.   We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs,   transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the right   answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the   decisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down any   path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and   the right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actually   better if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has already   calculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and   conversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback we   would have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well with   the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this   task. We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq frameworkdoes not support the downloading of data into external applications. Thetechnical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our currentdevelopment budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learneron the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make themistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices. If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of dayWednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of thissimulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please letme know if you would like to set up a meeting.

After the treasury comes due on Jan31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have to worryabout your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the value ofyour municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the bottomline is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keep inmind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you close thatposition you will probably get put those. Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.  Also, ifthere are any specifics that you want me to consider with your proposal suchas duration, maturity, etc. Steve******************************************************Notice Regarding Entry of Orders and Instructions:Please do not transmit orders and/or instructionsregarding your UBSPaineWebber account(s) by e-mail.Orders and/or instructions transmitted by e-mail willnot be accepted by UBSPaineWebber and UBSPaineWebberwill not be responsible for carrying out such ordersand/or instructions.

"Bob, I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be =on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, t=he application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression th=at yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball. =20 On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful su=ggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition f=orward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.=  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new =space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the existing= play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that is bord=ered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for =a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would not have to= add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bed=room should be minor construction.  In the back you could slope the roof un=til you were within the setback.  Then you could place a large dormer facin=g the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.  From the driveway =the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be =brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition.  The kitche=n and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would b=e more shaded.  That is the west side of the house so that might not be a b=ad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or di=ning room would still be possible.  Personally, I think opening the dining =room would be the better idea. I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exp=loring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest somethi=ng in case the variance was not granted.

For 2002, the Camry has been completely redesigned =on a brand-new platform.  The new generation is being sold solely as a four=-door sedan, although last  year's Camry Solara continues as a coupe and co=nvertible.

"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks.  Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center SouthYou will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures. NEC MonitorsThe NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk. Turret UsersAn ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"". Increased Information AccessThere are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below: Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	Weather Channel	12401	801	CNN Headlines News	12402	802	CNN Financial News	12403	803	CNBC	12404	804	MSNBC	12405	805	Bloomberg	12406	806	Financial News Network	12407	807	CNN	12408	808	Fox Sports	12409	809	ESPN1	12410	810	 Wireless TelephonyYou may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.   Wireless LANThe infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers. Amtel ReplacementAs a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available. Keeping an Open forumWe will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com"

"I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances. After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season. Ken Lay"

"As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored. We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.  "

"_____________________DAVID COURSEY_____________________ UNLUCKY 13: MY TOP TECH TURKEYS OF ALL TIME     It is sad that a fowl so noble--not to mention         savory--has come to symbolize lame thinking         and laughable losers. But alas, it has. And         so in honor of our national holiday I've assembled         a list of things that, well, I can't be thankful         for.

"[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	  November 23, 2001  		 	     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 		   Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	     Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	     Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	     Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	   Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	   Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	   Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	     Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

As per our meeting on Tuesday, please identify people you think will be good for the expert story roles. You can provide me a list and either contact them first or provide me with an introduction to get their commitment. Thanks a million in advance for your continued support of this project.

Just wanted to let you know that I will be taking over the role ofproducint the expert stories for our simulation.  I understand you will beobtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories.  Thank youfor your help.  Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind: Number of SMEs needed:  10Number of expert stories: 20-25Characteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, amix of structurers, originators and traders I've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we willfollow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The maindifference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time withthem for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take atleast 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday. (11/26-11/28)                         --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs(11/28-11/30)                         --Contact SMEs to give them background regardingthe simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time todiscuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.(12/3-12/6)               --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content weneed and where they can provide stories.                          --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review thestories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the videoshoot.                          --Make changes to stories, if necessary.                          --Send final stories and video shoot logistics toSMEs(12/10-12/12)                          --Video shoot Please let me know if you have any questions.

"Mike & Tony, Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.   I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors. We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.

We  See Upswing Con=tinuing   By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   Selective  accumulation r=emains in order.  The  early stages of recoveries from bear markets vary wi=dely in degree.  As time passes, however, deviations from the norm become f=ar less  dramatic.   Through  last Wednesday, when we went to press early b=ecause of the holiday,  31% of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to =September 21,  2001 had been recaptured. That's about average for rebounds =in  the postwar period. As shown in the table at the bottom right  of this =week's edition of The Outlook, at the two-month point  in the recoveries fr=om the nine former bear markets since World  War II, the S&P 500 had won ba=ck an average of 33% of the  bear market loss.   In  each of the nine insta=nces, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two mo=nths and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six =months. On average,  nearly two-thirds of the bear market loss was recovere=d after  six months and almost all of the bear market loss was recouped  in= a year.  Economic  and corporate news will remain bad for a while, but tha=t's typically  the case in the early part of a bull market that is associat=ed  with an economic recession. Stock prices start recovering well  before =the headlines improve. The September upturn in stocks would  be consistent =with the start of an economic expansion in the first  quarter of next year.=   While  P/E ratios currently are high, that won't necessarily keep the  b=ull market from progressing. The preceding economic expansion  was the long=est in history and gave rise to ""new era""  optimism. Corporations, especial=ly in information technology,  built production and sales capacity to level=s far greater than  proved justified. Those excesses are now being correcte=d, painfully.  Corporate earnings are in a severe contraction. Once the eco=nomy  begins to grow again, however, profits will rebound and P/Es will  st=art looking much more reasonable.

"Jim, Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.  Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low.   Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith.  I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at.   Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time.  Thank you anyway.

Here's a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner.Remember that the Roma one is about 5 years old, was a 15 yr leaseoriginally. The other two are new. The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonuskicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease incomeafter it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cashon cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma. We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us knowif you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they willlast long. With best regards, Jim Wills  - new analysis.xls << File: new analysis.xls >> "

"Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out. I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached. In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you.

"Jeff, JP Morgan is comparing a file of calculated daily curve shift to actual P&L.  Gas P&L for 2001 was 1.2 Billion but the theoretical curve shift was -13 million.  This is from a file assembled by David Port which is attached.  The biggest difference is 9/14 ($500 million).  This is probably money coming out of reserves.  Besides that day there are many smaller differences.  Can you help me by pulling the P&L packets from some of the larger days?  The answer might be that the file from RAC is bogus.

"  Greg, I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.   The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.   The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient. Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender? I will follow up with a phone call. Thanks, Phillip"
"Jeff, I reviewed your revised offer sheet.  I am OK with the effective income of $484K.  Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number.  The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon.  He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization.  See the attached spreadsheets.    "
Here is lakeside in your format.  Looks like 11% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note.  My biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering.  Also expenses were higher.  Why would we be able to do any better than the existing management?   I would like to come see it again on Wednesday.  I would be bringing 1 or 2 others.  Could we see it in the morning around 9:30 or 10 am? Phillip

In the case of the new         VeriChip, the answer is how long it takes for         the FDA to approve it.

" [IMAGE]  Market  Insight for December 24, 2001  From    [IMAGE]    The  Gl=obal Online Financial Services Firm  Please  note, the Market Insight will =not be published next week. Have a safe and happy holiday season!     Deadl=ine for Converting to a Roth IRA  December 31, 2001 is your deadline for co=nverting a Traditional  IRA to a Roth IRA. You should consult with a tax pr=ofessional  or accountant to help you determine if a conversion is advantag=eous  for you. For assistance, please call 1-800-934-4448, press  4 then 4 =to speak with a Retirement Plans Specialist.  Restraints  Will Be Overcome = We see an  irregular upward trend in the market.  Stocks  face some formid=able hurdles. The risk of additional terrorism  and fresh memories of the m=arket's 18-month downward spiral are  inhibiting buying. So are dismal four=th-quarter earnings pre-announcements  as the economic cycle approaches bot=tom, as well as continued  high P/E ratios on recession-depressed profits. =In addition, the  supply of stock for sale at prices just above current lev=els is  heavy, according to technical analysts.   But  we expect that these= and other impediments will be overcome. And  we note that market recoverie=s that proceed in halting fashion  amid widespread skepticism often are the= most sustainable.  Congress's  failure to pass a fiscal stimulus bill is n=ot a major negative,  according to S&P chief economist David Wyss. The econ=omy will  recover anyway, says Wyss, with absence of the package pinching  =GDP growth in 2002 by only 0.2%. Without fiscal stimulus, the  chances of a= 12th fed funds rate cut on January 30 are improved.    Based  on Wyss's fo=recast of GDP turning positive in the first quarter  and improving to an an=nual growth rate of 5% in the fourth quarter,  investors should be getting =more encouraging news before long.    The  recent rally lost upward momentu=m when it bumped up against overhead  resistance at 1170 on the S&P 500 on =December 5. With the  help of turn-of-the-year reinvestment demand, the nex=t attempt  to work through this supply is likely to be more successful, say=s  Mark Arbeter, S&P chief technical analyst. But even if it  is, the area =of resistance runs all the way up to 1313, so Arbeter  believes further pro=gress in the period ahead will be labored.    We  think the S&P 500 and Nas=daq will see double-digit gains over  the course of 2002. A portfolio alloc=ation of 65% stocks, 20%  bonds and 15% cash reserves remains appropriate. = As  a TD Waterhouse customer, you can view a complete copy of S&P's  The O=utlook (a $298 value) for FREE.

"For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market. Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.    I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning. Grigsby"

You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM.  All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.   Parking & Transportation Desk3-7060"

"The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise		These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.(iv)	Due Diligence	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year Louise"

"_____________________DAVID COURSEY_____________________ 2002 IN REVIEW: NOT PERFECT, BUT IT SURE BEAT 2001     Welcome to my 2002 Year in Review column, which         I feel very safe in asserting you are reading         here first. It's been a pretty good year, unless         of course you hate Microsoft, love Linux,         or were hoping HP and Compaq would unite. Read         on for my highlights of the year that's about         to happen. http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1231/2835377:8593142 # _____________________NEWS ANALYSIS_____________________ Sylvia Carr     MS STALLING?... MORE JOBS IN 2002... CABLE WOES PERSIST...     Could Microsoft be stalling? The nine    states still pursing the software giant's    antitrust case sure think so. They've    asked a federal judge to reject Microsoft's    request to delay the remedy hearings,    though Microsoft says any holdup is    the states' fault for seeking such a    tough remedy. http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1231/2835380:8593142   _____________________EXPERT ADVICE_____________________ Stephan Somogyi   A LOOK AHEAD: HOW 5 TECHNOLOGIES WILL FARE IN 2002    2001 was a great year for tech, but what about         this coming year?
